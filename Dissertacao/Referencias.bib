The considered gyroscopes include mechanical gyroscopes and optical gyroscopes at macro- and micro-scale. Particularly, gyroscope technologies commercially available, such as Mechanical Gyroscopes, silicon MEMS Gyroscopes, Ring Laser Gyroscopes (RLGs) and Fiber-Optic Gyroscopes (FOGs), are discussed. The main features of these gyroscopes and their technologies are linked to their performance.},

	abstract = {Accelerometers are used in most robot navigation systems as sensors for robot speed and localization. Normally, these accelerometers sense the body acceleration, which is integrated to determine the robot velocity, and cumulatively the robot position relative to the starting position. When the robot is moving on a horizontal surface, the computed speed will in general reflect the actual robot speed; however, when the robot is moving on an inclined surface, such as uphill or downhill motions, then the measured speed will include components due to gravity, which are not part of the actual robot speed. Therefore the computed speed will not reflect the actual robot speed. These gravity components must be compensated for in the speed computations to capture the actual robot speed. This paper proposes a computational approach for elimination of the gravity components from the accelerometer measurements using a 3-axis accelerometers combined with 3-axis gyro on tilted surfaces. The compensated accelerometer speed results were compared to simulated robot speed results on inclined surfaces, and were found to accurately reflect the actual robot speed. By using these compensated accelerometer results it becomes possible to determine the robot speed even under wheel slip conditions.}

	abstract="The current RoboCup Small Size League rules allow every team to set up their own global vision system as a primary sensor. This option, which is used by all participating teams, bears several organizational limitations and thus impairs the league's progress. Additionally, most teams have converged on very similar solutions, and have produced only few significant research results to this global vision problem over the last years. Hence the responsible committees decided to migrate to a shared vision system (including also sharing the vision hardware) for all teams by 2010. This system -- named SSL-Vision -- is currently developed by volunteers from participating teams. In this paper, we describe the current state of SSL-Vision, i.e. its software architecture as well as the approaches used for image processing and camera calibration, together with the intended process for its introduction and its use beyond the scope of the Small Size League.",
