	abstract = {Accelerometers are used in most robot navigation systems as sensors for robot speed and localization. Normally, these accelerometers sense the body acceleration, which is integrated to determine the robot velocity, and cumulatively the robot position relative to the starting position. When the robot is moving on a horizontal surface, the computed speed will in general reflect the actual robot speed; however, when the robot is moving on an inclined surface, such as uphill or downhill motions, then the measured speed will include components due to gravity, which are not part of the actual robot speed. Therefore the computed speed will not reflect the actual robot speed. These gravity components must be compensated for in the speed computations to capture the actual robot speed. This paper proposes a computational approach for elimination of the gravity components from the accelerometer measurements using a 3-axis accelerometers combined with 3-axis gyro on tilted surfaces. The compensated accelerometer speed results were compared to simulated robot speed results on inclined surfaces, and were found to accurately reflect the actual robot speed. By using these compensated accelerometer results it becomes possible to determine the robot speed even under wheel slip conditions.}

	abstract="The current RoboCup Small Size League rules allow every team to set up their own global vision system as a primary sensor. This option, which is used by all participating teams, bears several organizational limitations and thus impairs the league's progress. Additionally, most teams have converged on very similar solutions, and have produced only few significant research results to this global vision problem over the last years. Hence the responsible committees decided to migrate to a shared vision system (including also sharing the vision hardware) for all teams by 2010. This system -- named SSL-Vision -- is currently developed by volunteers from participating teams. In this paper, we describe the current state of SSL-Vision, i.e. its software architecture as well as the approaches used for image processing and camera calibration, together with the intended process for its introduction and its use beyond the scope of the Small Size League.",

	abstract = {Localization forms the heart of various autonomous mobile robots. For efficient navigation, these robots need to adopt effective localization strategy. This paper, presents a comprehensive review on localization system, problems, principle and approaches for mobile robots. First, we classify the localization problems in to three categories based on the information of initial position of the robot. Next, we discuss on robot position update principles. Then, we discuss key techniques to localize the mobile robot such as: probabilistic approach, autonomous map building and radio frequency identification (RFID) based scheme. In the probabilistic localization section, we discuss the Markov localization and Kalman filter along with its extended versions. Autonomous map building focuses on the widely used simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach. This section also discusses on applying SLAM to localize brain-controlled mobile robots. Next, we discuss on applying evolutionary approaches to estimate optimal position. The RFID scheme addresses on effective utilization of RFID tags to track objects and position the robot. We then analyze on position and orientation errors occurred by different localization strategies. We conclude this paper by highlighting future research possibilities.}

	ABSTRACT = {In recent years, e-commerce businesses have seen an increase in the daily volume of packages to be delivered, as well as an increase in the number of particularly demanding customer expectations. In this respect, the delivery mechanism became prohibitively expensive, particularly for the final kilometer. To stay competitive and meet the increased demand, businesses began to look for innovative autonomous delivery options for the last mile, such as autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles/drones, which are a promising alternative for the logistics industry. Following the success of drones in surveillance and remote sensing, drone delivery systems have begun to emerge as a new solution to reduce delivery costs and delivery time. In the coming years, autonomous drone sharing systems will be an unavoidable logistical solution, especially with the new laws/recommendations introduced by the Flight World Organization on how to organize the operations of these special unmanned airline systems. This paper provides a comprehensive literature survey on a set of relevant research issues and highlights the representative solutions and concepts that have been proposed thus far in the design and modeling of the logistics of drone delivery systems, with the purpose of discussing the respective performance levels reached by the various suggested approaches. Furthermore, the paper also investigates the central problems to be addressed and briefly discusses and outlines a series of interesting new research avenues of relevance for drone-based package delivery systems.},

	ABSTRACT = {Intelligent mobile robots that can move independently were laid out in the real world around 100 years ago during the second world war after advancements in computer science. Since then, mobile robot research has transformed robotics and information engineering. For example, robots were crucial in military applications, especially in teleoperations, when they emerged during the second world war era. Furthermore, after the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in robotics, they became autonomous or more intelligent. Currently, mobile robots have been implemented in many applications like defense, security, freight, pattern recognition, medical treatment, mail delivery, infrastructure inspection and developments, passenger travel, and many more because they are more intelligent nowadays with artificial intelligence technology. To study the developments of mobile robots, we have studied an extensive literature survey of the last 50 years. In this article, we discuss a complete century of mobile robotics research, major sensors used in robotics, some major applications of mobile robots, and their impact on our lives and in applied engineering.},

	ABSTRACT = {The following work presents an overview of smart sensors and sensor fusion targeted at biomedical applications and sports areas. In this work, the integration of these areas is demonstrated, promoting a reflection about techniques and applications to collect, quantify and qualify some physical variables associated with the human body. These techniques are presented in various biomedical and sports applications, which cover areas related to diagnostics, rehabilitation, physical monitoring, and the development of performance in athletes, among others. Although some applications are described in only one of two fields of study (biomedicine and sports), it is very likely that the same application fits in both, with small peculiarities or adaptations. To illustrate the contemporaneity of applications, an analysis of specialized papers published in the last six years has been made. In this context, the main characteristic of this review is to present the largest quantity of relevant examples of sensor fusion and smart sensors focusing on their utilization and proposals, without deeply addressing one specific system or technique, to the detriment of the others.},

	abstract="Wheeled mobile robots are still the first choice when it comes to industrial or domotic applications. The robot's navigation system aims to reliably determine the robot's position, velocity and orientation and provide it to control and trajectory guidance modules. The most frequently used sensors are inertial measurement units (IMU) combined with an absolute position sensing mechanism. The dead reckoning approach using IMU suffers from integration drift due to noise and bias. To overcome this limitation we propose the use of the inertial system in combination with mechanical odometers and a vision based system. These two sensor complement each other as the vision sensor is accurate at low-velocities but requires long computation time, while the inertial sensor is able to track fast movements but suffers from drift. The information from the sensors is integrated through a multi-rate fusion scheme. Each of the sensor systems is assumed to have it's own independent sampling rate, which may be time-varying. Data fusion is performed by a multi-rate Kalman filter. The paper describes the inertial and vision navigation systems, and the data fusion algorithm. Simulation and experimental results are presented.",

	abstract = {This paper presents Scan-SLAM, a new generalization of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). SLAM implementations based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) data fusion have traditionally relied on simple geometric models for defining landmarks. This limits EKF-SLAM to environments suited to such models and tends to discard much potentially useful data. The approach presented in this paper is a marriage of EKF-SLAM and scan correlation. Landmarks are no longer defined by analytical models; instead they are defined by templates composed of raw sensed data. These templates can be augmented as more data become available so that the landmark definition improves with time. A new generic observation model is derived that is generated by scan correlation, and this permits stochastic location estimation for landmarks with arbitrary shape within the Kalman filter framework. The statistical advantages of an EKF representation are augmented with the general applicability of scan matching. Scan matching also serves to enhance data association reliability by providing a shape metric for landmark disambiguation. Experimental results in an outdoor environment are presented which validate the algorithm.}
